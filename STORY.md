The future is a dystopian land full of feuding government's technology has advanced that organ transplants allow those to live forever. Old crazy kings who have lived forever. Your brother is kidnapped while you guys are in a fight, he storms out and gets caught. Your brother does not return home, you begin your quest to save him.

var friendLikesYou = 0;
var youCareAboutFriend = 0;

You run into the “friend” who says he’s on the way to save his love. Offers to go with you. [DECISION POINT?]

You two run into a highwayman. Highwayman requires $$ from you. [DECISION POINT] If you’re feeling good: you pay the highwayman, you both go on your merry way [friendLikesYou ++]. If you’re feeling bad: you claim to be penniless to make your new friend pay [friendLikesYou --].

You both stop for the night and your friend tells you the love story of him and his lover [youCareAboutFriend = based on valence].If you like the story it’s good, if not well bad. The love story is about how they are childhood loves, he never got the chance to tell her everything about how he feels. They continue the quest.

You continue onward to the next step, bad guys attack! If you’re feeling super negative you push over your friend & the bad guys are taken care of [friendLikesYou --]. Otherwise you both run away and escape [friendLikesYou ++, youLikeFriend ++].

You arrive at the walled city. Run through the marketplace, which is maze-like. In the marketplace, you are approached by a stranger who whispers that they can get you inside the fortress. [EMOTION BASED DECISION POINT] If negative, you don’t trust them & push past. If positive, you trust and follow them.

If your friend is still with you, they choose the opposite of what you do, now you’re separated.


FORK : follow the person
The person leads you through a sewer tunnel and up into the dungeons. He smiles winningly, winks, holds your arm as you wind through passageways branching too numerously to track. he leads you to a manhole grate, lifts it, and lifts you out ahead of him…. as soon as you’re up, he yells for guards and slams down the cover. You’re now inside the castle, but the guards know you’re here.

FORK: don’t follow the person
Your friend goes with them while you continue onwards, your friend becomes trapped with his lover.

You go around the long way and have to dodge some extra bad guys. Arrive in the dungeons, guards know you’re there because you ran past them.

END FORK:
You hear screaming at the end of the hall. You run down the hall and arrive at a big room. Your friend is there at one end, the love and the little brother are there too.

How does it end? Depends how everybody is feeling:

* Your friend hates you
  * You feel bad
    * You freeze. Everyone dies. You are trapped and the game ends with all the characters dying. (FORK 1)
  * You feel good
    * You don’t like your friend
      * Then you go to save your brother and the friend has already traded and trapped you to sacrifice you for his love. He confronts you as you go to save the brother and shoots you or something. You die with your brother and him and his love run off, their happy ending. (FORK 2)
    * You like your friend
    * You sacrifice yourself, your friend saves his love and your brother and they escape (FORK 5)
* Your friend likes you
  * You feel bad
    * You freeze, but friend sacrifices self for you. You get trapped in the cellar with other characters including the love and brother. The friend defeats the bad guys and saves the day, but as you guys are escaping gets caught and in the end dies. You make sure the love and brother escape. Semi-happy ending. (FORK 3)
  * You feel good
    * Everyone is happy. You and your friend work together to save everyone. (FORK 4)
